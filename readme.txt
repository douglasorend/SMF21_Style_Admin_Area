[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod reorganizes the layout of SMF v2.0.x's Admin area so that it closely matches SMF 2.1 Alpha 1's menu, as of July 28, 2014.  It also rewrites the "Adminstration Center" page to look like SMF 2.1 Alpha 1....

Most of the modifications are to [b]Admin.php[/b] and [b]Admin.template.php[/b], with a few other edits to make the moved menu entries work.

In SMF 2.1 Alpha 1, there is no Core Features page.  Those settings have been migrated to the individual pages to enable/disable the feature.  These modifications are not duplicated, as they would add MUCH, MUCH more code to the admin area....
